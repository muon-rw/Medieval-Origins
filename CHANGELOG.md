## 7.0.0-alpha-1
*Initial alpha port to 1.21.1*


**There will be bugs.**
**Back up your worlds before installing, and frequently while playing!**

- No longer bundles Apugli or requires Pehkui - performance should be significantly better!
- Now Fabric only - when Origins Fabric is out of alpha and Sinytra Connector updates, I'll contribute to improving their compatibility wherever possible
- Valkyries now get extra Vanquisher points for slaying undead bosses
- High Elf's Glacial Step now increases level of Frost Walker
- Added a keybind "Tertiary Active" for pixie effects and the new revenant command power.
- "Golden Armor" now also includes gold-trimmed armor
- Revenants can now command their summons to "sit", or teleport all owned summons to them
- Revenants can now eat bones/heads even at full hunger
- Revenants are now limited to 5 summons of any type at a time
- Revenant summon kills now grant EXP and kill credit
- Revenant summons will now always drop any items you give them
- Revenant skeletons will now no longer be targeted by tamed wolves
- Revenant's combat summons now expire (5 minutes for zombies, 10 for skeletons, 30 for wither skeletons), added a duration bar 
- Putrid Communion now increases the *duration* of combat summons
- *Attributes* of combat summons are now only determined by Soul Spell Power
- Fixed some death messages being untranslated
- Fixed a crash when a Valkyrie cleared multiple negative effects from another player at once
- Fixed spell damage powers crashing on dedicated servers if both Amethyst Imbuement and Mythic Upgrades were installed
